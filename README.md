Scripts Used to Calibrate Nature Run Experiments

When looking at the vertical localizaiton consider looking at the correlation of observations sampled at a spacific height with the perturbation forecast field.  This is important since the climatology of T,qv,u, and v all change drastically with height in the boundary layer.  This has large consequences on the correlation field if youconsider heights both above and below the observation location at the same time
